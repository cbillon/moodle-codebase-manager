The rate of upgrading Moodle and the significance of the LTS

With each new version, we face the challenge of ensuring our essential plugins continue to work smoothly. Unfortunately, the Moodle upgrade process isn’t the simplest, and this discourages many of us from always staying on the latest versions. The reality is that sometimes an upgrade done too hastily or without thoroughly checking plugin compatibility can end up causing more headaches than benefits.

Until Moodle simplifies this upgrade and compatibility process – and perhaps even creates a more robust system to assess plugin compatibility before updating – many will remain hesitant to move to the latest versions.
