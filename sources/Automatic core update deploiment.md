## Automatic core update deployment


Since Moodle 2.3, admins are notified of Moodle update available. It would be nice is the new version could be downloaded and deployed automatically by Moodle itself. 

I've tagged this as a partner issue as this is a major risk for the partners. We need an easy method to point the update repo check at our internal repositories as we maintain a set of patches and customizations for some clients. If they pull from core, then they WILL break their site.
