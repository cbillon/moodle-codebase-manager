Security isn’t a feature. It’s the foundation. 
Because security isn’t just about protecting data - it’s about protecting trust.
Our commitment to safeguarding users’ data and protecting learning environments is rooted in a security by design philosophy, meaning that security considerations are prioritised from
the earliest stages of software development through to deployment and ongoing support.

Community-driven resilience is another defining
characteristic of open-source security. When a vulnerability
is discovered in Moodle LMS, the global community
- including Moodle, Moodle Certified Partners, and
independent developers - mobilises to implement a fix. In
this model, security is not the sole responsibility of a single
organisation but a continuous, collective effort.
The strengths of open-source community security include:
• Rapid identification and resolution of vulnerabilities.
• Shared responsibility for ongoing improvement.
• Broader scrutiny across diverse sectors and use
cases.

The need for rigorous peer review 
One of the most significant challenges lies in the diversity of contributors. With individuals and organisations around the world submitting improvements, there is a risk that some code changes may not undergo
sufficiently rigorous review. Without a strong peer
review process, flaws such as buffer overflows, improper
input validation, or configuration weaknesses could
inadvertently be introduced. To mitigate this, Moodle
implements structured peer review protocols, requiring
that contributions are thoroughly assessed before being
accepted into the codebase.

Our commitment to safeguarding users’ data and protecting learning environments is rooted in a security by design philosophy, meaning that security considerations are prioritised from the earliest stages of software development through to deployment and ongoing support.

Automatic security updates : A managed service ensures that Moodle core software, server components, and security patches are applied without delays.
