## Plugin Approval Process

The plugin approval process in Moodle undergoes a detailed review to ensure that all best practices for development and security are followed. For this, there is clear documentation on how to contribute plugins, which you can check out here: Plugin Contribution. There, you’ll find a comprehensive guide on the necessary steps to submit and review plugins.

Additionally, there is a specific checklist for validation, which analyzes various aspects such as security, functionality, and compatibility. You can review the items in this checklist here: Plugin Contribution Checklist.

If you’re interested in seeing how this process works in practice, the Moodle Tracker is an excellent place to follow plugin reviews in real time. For example, here are some recent cases that showcase how these analyses are conducted:
